# speed-mod

This is a mod for *The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth* that:
* Removes the intro cutscene
* Removes all of the ending cutscenes
* Removes the credits cutscene
* Removes all of the boss introduction cutscenes
* Removes all of the floor transition cutscenes
* Removes the pedestal item pickup animation
* Sets the "shake" animation to 0 frames (this is the animation responsible for Book of Revelations, rainbow poop, black heart depletion, and so forth)
* Removes the Monstro death animation
* Slightly modifies the title screen

Note that there is 1 frame of lag whenever the shake animation is supposed to play (with the exception of entering or exiting Curse Rooms). I'm not sure how to fix this without the LUA API DLC.

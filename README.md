# speed-mod

This is a mod for *The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth* that:
* Removes the intro cutscene
* Removes all of the ending cutscenes
* Removes the credits cutscene
* Removes all of the boss introduction cutscenes
* Removes all of the floor transition cutscenes
* Sets the "shake" animation to 0 frames (this is the animation responsible for Book of Revelations, rainbow poop, black heart depletion, and so forth)
* Slightly modifies the title screen.

Note that there is 1 frame of lag whenever the shake animation is supposed to play; I'm not sure how to fix this without the LUA API DLC.
